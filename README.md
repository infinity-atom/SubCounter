Type the channel id in to the input box. Press Go to check subscribers.
## Where to find the ID?
You can find it in some channel URLs.
If the channel has a custom URL, the [TubeBuddy](https://www.tubebuddy.com/) extension can show this. Also, [this website](https://commentpicker.com/youtube-channel-id.php) works.
